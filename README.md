## Hey there! I'm Noratan.

I'm an Ethical Hacking & Cybersecurity student who is very passionate about keeping education free, particularly
language learning. I love the idea of travelling the globe one day to see the world's fascinating cultures! Additionally,
I enjoy reading, writing and drawing stories/comics as well as gaming.

I would like to be able to travel while working as a security consultant/analyst/auditor in order to
protect businesses worldwide and to have the opportunity to meet a wide variety of clients.

|HTML & CSS              |Punjabi - Currently Studying|
